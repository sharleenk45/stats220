# stats220 Assignment 1


Check out my [website!](https://sharleenk45.github.io/stats220/)

## Purpose
This repository is part of an assignment for a Statistics (Data Technologies) class. The purpose is to create a meme to demonstrate our understanding of the first module in the course.
I have attempted to achieve this by:

* using numerous spongebob images 
* using inspiration from my everyday life experiance to create the meme

To match my meme, I have taken a satirical approach to my website/ index.md file.
